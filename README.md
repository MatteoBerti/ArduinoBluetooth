# project info

*	"ArduinoCircuit.pdf" - The circuit scheme for Arduino, with HC-05 Bluetooth Module, LED and LM35 temperature sensor.
* 	"\ArduinoSketch"	- Folder with the Arduino sketch file .ino
*	"\AndroidStudioProject"	- Folder with the Android Studio project necessary for the communication between the app and Arduino

! I used a LED to send data from the app to Arduino, and a temperature sensor to receive data from Arduino to the app. With some changes you can redesign the code to your purposes.
